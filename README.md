***This app is far away to be perfect, it's possible that it has a lot of bugs or inaccuracies. I do not take any responsibility for the possible corruptions of your files.***

## Description:

FH_MediaPlayer is a simple tool to reproduce audios and videos from your gallery. It's my personal project for the Tesina of 'Ingegneria del Software' course and its purpose is to be a way for me to learn and play
with some JavaFX tools, and apply general Software Engineering rules.

This project aims to be extensible and modifiable according to the main rules of the Software Engineering. If you want to take a closer look of these concepts or you just want to understand how this app works, I recommend you to read my personal Tesina, you can find it in the ***tesina*** folder.
